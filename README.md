# Korea-Dam-Reservoir-Google-Earth

We are Greenfingers Pohang. We have uploaded a KML file that could be used as Google Earth locations. In our files, there are korean version and english version of all the dam, reservoir, dike, and barrage in Korea.
I used this file in order to check the location of Koreanomelania nodifila in Korea.

Thank you enjoy!!!
